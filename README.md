# TickerTracker
### TickerTracker is an app where users create their porfolio of stocks they are interested in. This app allows the user to keep track of all their transactions associated with each stock and gives them the total amount they have invested on each stock. The user can at anytime delete any of the stocks they are no longer interested in.

# Next Steps  
### Future enhancements for my TickerTracker app: 
* Incorporating an API to gather current market data for each stock 
* When a user adds stocks to their porfolio, the app should only allow the user to add stocks that currently exist
* Font color on stocks should be red or green depending on whether the stock was up or down on the day
* Programming the app to not allow repeat stocks
* More CSS styling
